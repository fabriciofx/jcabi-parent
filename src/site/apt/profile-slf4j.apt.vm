SLF4J and LOG4J Logging

  The profile is activated automatically when
  <<<src/test/resources/log4j.properties>>> file exists in your
  project. The following two dependencies become available in classpath
  (in <<<test>>> scope):
  <<<org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12>>> and <<<log4j:log4j>>>.

  A good practice is
  1) to annotate your methods/classes with
  {{{../jcabi-aspects/annotation-loggable.html}<<<@Loggable>>>}},
  2) activate
  {{{./profile-aspectj.html}<<<aspectj>>>}} profile, and
  3) create <<<src/test/resources/log4j.properties>>> file with LOG4J configuration
  for unit testing.

  This page explains the format of log4j.properties:
  {{{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/manual.html}Short introduction to log4j: Ceki Gülcü, March 2002}}.
  This is a short example that works:

+--
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, CONSOLE
log4j.appender.CONSOLE=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout=com.jcabi.log.MulticolorLayout
log4j.appender.CONSOLE.layout.ConversionPattern=[%color{%p}] %t %c: %m%n
+--

  In this example we use
  {{{../jcabi-log/multicolor.html}<<<MulticolorLayout>>>}} from
  {{{../jcabi-log/index.html}<<<jcabi-log>>>}},
  which colors log output depending on log priorities.
