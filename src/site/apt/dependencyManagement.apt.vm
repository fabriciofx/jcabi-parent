Pre-Defined Maven Dependencies

  <<<com.jcabi:parent>>> POM declares a number of most useful
  artifacts in its <<<dependencyManagement>>> section. You can use
  them without specifying <<<version>>>. Thus, you don't need to worry
  about keeping versions up to date. When you're ready to upgrade, just
  change the version of our parent POM and all dependencies will
  be upgraded automatically.

  These dependencies are defined always:

   * {{{http://www.jcabi.com/jcabi-log/}<<<jcabi-log>>>}},
     {{{http://www.jcabi.com/jcabi-log/}<<<jcabi-manifests>>>}},
     and all other <<<jcabi-*>>> artifacts.

   * {{{http://commons.apache.org/io/}<<<commons-io>>>}},
     {{{http://commons.apache.org/lang/}<<<commons-lang>>>}},
     and almost all other {{{http://commons.apache.org/}Apache commons}}.

   * {{{https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/}<<<com.google.guava:guava>>>}}.

   * <<<xml-apis:xml-apis>>>.

   * {{{http://projectlombok.org/}<<<org.projectlombok:lombok>>>}}.

   * <<<org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12>>> and <<<log4j:log4j>>>.

   * {{{http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/ANTLR+3+Wiki+Home}<<<org.antlr:antlr-runtime>>>}}.

  Check out
  {{{https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-parent/blob/master/pom.xml}<<<pom.xml>>>}}
  for a complete list of dependencies, we update it every month.
