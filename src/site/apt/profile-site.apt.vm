"Site" Profile for Advanced Maven Site Configuration

  Most of production site content takes time to build (for example,
  JavaDoc API, changes report, etc). It's convenient to move that
  configuration plugins to a profile, which is activated only
  once in a while. Profile <<<site>>> does exactly that, grouping together
  most time-consuming reporting plugins.
  The profile can be activated only manually from
  command line, e.g.:

+--
$ mvn clean install site-deploy -Psite
+--

  The profile configures
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/}<<<maven-site-plugin>>>}}
  with all required reporting plugins:

   * {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-project-info-reports-plugin/}<<<maven-project-info-reports-plugin>>>}}
     creates basic "project information" reports.

   * {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/}<<<maven-javadoc-plugin>>>}}
     builds JavaDoc API documentation in <<<./apidocs-${sign}{project.version}>>>
     directory.

   * {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/cobertura-maven-plugin/}<<<cobertura-maven-plugin>>>}}
     generates code coverage report.

   * {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugin-tools/maven-plugin-plugin/}<<<maven-plugin-plugin>>>}}
     generate documentation for maven plugin.

   * {{{http://mojo.codehaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/}<<<versions-maven-plugin>>>}}
     reports about available dependency and plugin versions.

  Also <<<site>>> profile has the following plugins:

   * {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-docck-plugin/index.html}<<<maven-docck-plugin>>>}}
     checks the quality of Maven project documentation.

  You can add your own reporting plugins, for example (pay
  attention to <<<combine.children>>> attribute of <<<reportPlugins>>>
  element):

+--
<profiles>
  [...]
  <profile>
    <id>site</id>
    <build>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
          <configuration>
            <reportPlugins combine.children="append">
              <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-changes-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.8</version>
                <reportSets>
                  <reportSet>
                    <reports>
                      <report>changes-report</report>
                    </reports>
                  </reportSet>
                </reportSets>
              </plugin>
            </reportPlugins>
          </configuration>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </build>
  </profile>
</profiles>
+--

  Also you can add your own plugins that should be
  executed when you're building a production site. Just add them
  to the <<<site>>> profile.
